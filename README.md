# Stem-Cell-System
Stem cells are most researched elements of medical history. These cells help in saving lives via restoration and regeneration. Currently all the cellsâ€™ data exists in the form of report. Searching, managing these reports is difficult as the paper records must be stored carefully and to search for one cell the researchers must go through all records. Furthermore, during the case of accidents, where blood loss occurs, the need for blood is anticipated.  As they are on-paper records, they are prone to wear and tear and eventually loss of valuable data. Furthermore, due to many records, space issues arise.  This archaic system also makes it difficult for the hospitals find availability in nearby labs. Also, they must be aware of which lab has the desired cells. This results in a need for an effective and efficient Management system that can solve all the issues mentioned above.
